Build, commit, and publish the site:

1. Run `hugo` to build the site. If the build fails, stop and report the error.
2. Stage all changed files with `git add -A`.
3. Create a git commit with a descriptive message summarizing the changes.
4. Push to the remote with `git push`.

Report the result of each step.
